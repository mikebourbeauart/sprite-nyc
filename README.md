Transform this 3D city aerial view into isometric pixel art in the style of SimCity 4. Use a limited 32-bit color palette with crisp pixel edges and no anti-aliasing. Buildings should have clean geometric shapes with flat shading, visible pixel-level detail on rooftops and facades. Roads should be clean gray with pixel-sharp lane markings. Trees should be simple rounded pixel clusters in 2-3 shades of green. Maintain the exact isometric camera angle and building positions from the original image.

Strict pixel art rules: every edge must snap to whole pixels, no sub-pixel blending, no gradients, no blur. Each building face should use exactly 2-3 flat color values for light, mid, and shadow.
